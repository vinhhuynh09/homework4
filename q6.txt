1. No, the change inside increment_int_a does not change the variable a after the function call.
2. Yes, the change inside increment_int_b does change the variable b after the function call.
3. The answers to #1 and #2 are different because in #1, you are dealing with an immutable integer. When 'a' is passed to the function, it is
being passed by value so the value of a in the function increment_int_a() is local and will not affect the value of 'a' in the main. However, in
#2, you are dealing with a mutable dictionary. When 'b' is passed to the function, it is being passed by reference so the changes made for 'b'
in the function will also have the same changes made to the varible 'b' in the main.
