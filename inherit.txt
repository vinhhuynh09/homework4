One use for why you would use inheritance in a program is to allow for code reusability. Inheritance involves creating a base class and
derived classes from the base case. Therefore, code from the base class can be reused in the derived class. Instead of needing to rewrite
the same code for each class, inheritance allows you to extend derived classes to base classes. This way the amount of repeated code is limited
and makes the program easier to maintain. For example, if there is a base class named "Animal", you can create subclasses such as "Dog" and
"Cat" which both have some similar properties so both derived classes can reuse some of the function implemented in the Animal class.

A second use for why you would use inheritance in a program is to use polymorphism. In order for polymorphism to occur, there must be
inheritance involved. Polymorphism allows objects of various classes to be treated as objects of a superclass. This allows for implementing
more generic code for objects of different classes, as long as they are all derived from the same parent class. This makes the code simpler
as objects of different classes can be implemented in similar fashion. For example, if you have a parent class "Shape" with the derived classes
"Circle" and "Rectangle", polymorphism allows you to implement code for each shape without knowing what type of shape they are.
